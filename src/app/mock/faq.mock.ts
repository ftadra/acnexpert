                question: 'How much does AcneXpert cost?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'We are currently running a first month special promotion price of $49. Each visit thereafter is $99 per month. The average length of treatment is 5 months although this may vary by 1-2 months depending on how you respond to treatment.'

                question: 'Can you explain the cost?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'Yes! We are the first and only service that offers Accutane via telemedicine. Our fees include paying our doctors, our business expenses and the administrative costs required to administer Accutane in a safe and convenient way. Prior to AcneXpert the only way to get a prescription for Accutane was to go to a doctor’s office in person every month for 5 months. The time and cost required for 5-6 monthly physician appointments kept this life-altering treatment out of reach for so many patients.'

                question: 'What is not included in the cost?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'The Accutane (generic isotretinoin) medication is not part of the cost. The prescription will be sent to your local pharmacy. If you have insurance, you can use your prescription benefits to pay for the medication. The cost will vary based on your individual insurance. Many patients pay as little as a $5 copay. The cost of the bloodwork is also not included. These will also run through your insurance and are very common, inexpensive tests (liver function, cholesterol and a pregnancy test for women). Please provide your health insurance card to both your localpharmacy and local lab.'

                question: 'Do you offer refunds?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'YES! If at your first consultation we do not agree on a treatment, your credit card will be refunded the cost of your initial visit. If you and your doctor decide to treat with topical therapies (creams) rather than Accutane, you would still be responsible to pay the initial consultation fee.'

                question: 'Can I use insurance for my consultation?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'AcneXpert does not directly contract with insurances. We do, however, provide you with our diagnosis and treatment codes so that you can submit a claim to your insurance company on your own behalf. Your insurance company would then reimburse you for the doctor’s visit as per your insurance contract.'

                question: 'Do you offer anything other than Accutane for acne?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'Yes. You and your doctor will discuss different treatment options and you may decide to use topical therapies (creams) instead of Accutane. If that is the case, your doctor will prescribe them to your local pharmacy. We typically recommend a 1 month follow up to assess improvement.'

                answer: 'We treat patients aged 12 and older. Any patient under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent/guardian for the initial consultation. For follow up consultations, the parent/guardian must fill out the follow up form with the help of the minor patient.'

                question: 'Does Accutane work?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'Yes! Accutane is the only acne medication that can permanently alter the natural course of acne. Millions of patients in the US have successfully been treated with it since 1982.  The majority of patients experience long-term improvement in acne severity after one course of treatment. Continued improvement may occur for several months after stopping the treatment.'

                question: 'How does Accutane work?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'Accutane is a pill that works to counteract several factors contributing to the development of acne. Accutane shrinks oil glands and significantly reduces sebum (oil) production. This decrease in sebum inhibits the sebum-dependent bacteriumCutibacteriumacnes, which is a key promoter of inflammation in acne vulgaris. Accutane also inhibits blackhead and whiteheadformation (comedogenesis).'

                question: 'How well does it work?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'The goal of treatment is to clear the skin. Studies suggest between 75-90% of patients will experience clear or nearly clear skin by the end of treatment. Of those patients, 50% will be “cured” of their acne, with the remaining patients experiencing mild flares 1-2 years later. On rare occasions, patients may require a second course of treatment with Accutane 6-18 months after the initial course.'

                question: 'How do I take it?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'It is a capsule (the generic name is isotretinoin) that you will take twice per day with fatty food (which helps its absorption). The average course of treatment is 5 months.'
            },
            {
                question: 'Why is the treatment 5 months?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'The target dose for most patients is a total of 150 mg/kg of their body weight, which is the cumulative amount received during the treatment. Studies suggest this target dose gives patients the best chance to stay clear, which is our ultimate goal. Since each month you will receive around 30 mg/kg, if you multiply by 5 months that would equal the target 150 mg/kg. Patients will usually begin to clear after month 2 but should complete the 5 months to avoid relapsing.'
            },
            {
                question: 'Will I ever need longer than 5 months?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'Possibly. If the dose needs to be lowered during therapy, if you are slower to respond to treatment or if this is your second course of treatment your doctor may recommend a slightly longer course of treatment, typically an extra 1-2 months.'

                question: 'What is Accutane made from?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'Accutane is a naturally occurring derivative of vitamin A and is detectable in the bloodstream of all people. Vitamin A in large doses has the same effects as Accutane. Accutane is formed naturally in the body from the Vitamin A present in the bloodstream. This is why large amountsof Vitamin A taken during pregnancy cause the same birth defects that Accutane does. Fortunately, because it is a naturally occurring product, the body is able to quickly remove Accutane from the bloodstream.'

                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'Chapped lips (90%), countered by a using Vaseline, Aquaphor (or similar) as a lip moisturizer.Dry skin and itching (80%) helped by frequent moisturizer creams.Dryness of nose, mild nosebleed (80%), helped by "AYR nasal gel" or similar.Irritation of the eyelids and eyes (40%).Joint and muscle pains (15%). Treated by reducing vigorous activity or ibuprofen.Rash (7%)Intestinal symptoms (5%)Headache (5%)Increased sensitivity to sun (5%), Decreased night vision (<1%), Depression, thoughts of suicide (<1%).'
            },
            {
                question: 'I heard Accutane is a very dangerous medicine?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'This is an extremely common perception amongst patients and even doctors that don’t specialize in dermatology. It usually stems from the special monitoring required for Accutane use. If a pregnant woman takes Accutane, it will cause birth defects in the developing baby (aswould high doses of vitamin A). For this reason, in 1992 the government set up a special program called “ipledge” to help monitor patients on Accutane and reduce the chances of pregnant women receiving Accutane. Fortunately, Accutane is removed from the blood very quickly. It is undetectable in the blood 9 days after use. Thankfully, while the beautifully clear skin of Accutane lasts, the pregnancy risk does not. Thirty days after treatment it is safe to getpregnant and there will be no risk to future pregnancies. There is no danger for men who are taking Accutane while trying to conceive.\n\nAnother concern that often arises surrounding Accutane is the risk of depression. This is a rarely reported side effect (<1%) and recent large studies suggest that depression actually improves with the resolution of acne. That being said, we do always monitor our patients for depression while they are taking Accutane. Please let us know immediately if you feel you are experiencing new or worsening depression as a side effect of your Accutane treatment.'

                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'If you are female, you must also choose 2 forms of birth control or state you are abstinent and not sexually active at all. Once per month after your doctor’s follow up visit you will login to the ipledge website and answer comprehension questions regarding pregnancy prevention. You will also get a pregnancy test each month, which will be ordered with your labs.'

                question: 'What do I have to do each month?',
                // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
                answer: 'Every 30 days you will:-Get your blood drawn at a local lab. Our initial lab order automatically repeats each month, soyou can just go to the lab each month without any additional documents from us.-Complete your monthly AcneXpert renewal form to update the doctor on your progress.-Upload your progress photos.-*For females you will need to login to ipledge after your renewal is completed by your doctor to answer your monthly birth control questions. Your login information will be emailed or mailed to you from ipledge. You will have 7 days to do this before the ipledge system locks you out – so we recommend doing this immediately after your visit is completed. After this is complete, your pharmacy will then be able to dispense your medication.'

                answer: 'The doctor will electronically prescribe it to your local pharmacy. Once your visit is completed, you can go to your pharmacy and give your name, date of birth and ipledge ID number (extremely important!!) to pick it up.'
