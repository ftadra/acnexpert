      "DESCRIPTION": "AcneXpert was founded by board certified US physicians with extensive experience treating patients with Accutane (isotretinoin). \n\n It’s the first online medicine service that gives patients across the country access to treatment with Accutane, which is the single most effective therapy for acne there is. \n\n By cutting out landlord fees and creating a straightforward treatment pipeline, AcneXpert can offer a more affordable medical service —all from the comfort of the patient’s own home and favorite local pharmacy."

      "TITLE": "Our Mission",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Getting acne-free is a life-changing experience. \n\n More than 30% of America’s teenagers have low self-esteem due to acne. Accutane clears 85% of patients of ALL acne by Week 16, and produces long-term remission. \n\n Seeing a doctor in person once a month left the treatment out of reach for so many busy teens, young adults, and parents. \n\n We believe that people everywhere should be able to take full advantage of Accutane’s benefits in a safe and convenient way. We’re committed to helping our patients banish their acne for good, and to providing remote care of the very highest standard."
