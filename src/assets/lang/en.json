Accutane clears 85% of patients of ALL acne by Week 16, and produces long-term remission. \n\n Seeing a doctor in person once a month left the treatment out of reach for so many busy teens, young adults, and parents. \n\n We believe that people everywhere should be able to take full advantage of Accutane’s benefits in a safe and convenient way. We’re committed to helping our patients banish their acne for good, and to providing remote care of the very highest standard."
